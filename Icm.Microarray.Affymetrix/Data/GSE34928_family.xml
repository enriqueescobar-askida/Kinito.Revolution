      <Treatment-Protocol>
Morphologically normal surface epithelium cells were obtained by gently scraping, 2-3 times with a rubber scraper, the ovarian surface epithelium of the surgical specimen provided by the pathologist. The cells collected were then seeded in standard OSE medium consisting of 50:50 medium 199:105 (Sigma) supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 2.5 µg/mL amphotericin B and 50 µg/mL gentamicin.
      </Treatment-Protocol>
      <Growth-Protocol>
After rinsing, an explant of the surgical specimen was placed in 35-mm culture dishes, and held surface down so that the ovarian surface epithelium was maintained in a small amount of medium in contact with the bottom of the culture dishes, allowing the NOSEs to colonize the plastic. The cells were then passaged at 80% of confluence. A subgroup of NOSEs was cultivated in a modified medium (MM) i.e. the standard OSE medium supplemented with epidermal growth factor, hydrocortisone, insulin and bovine pituitary extract. Finally, tumors of ovaries (TOVs) were established in OSE medium supplemented with 10% FBS.
      </Growth-Protocol>
      <Molecule>total RNA</Molecule>
      <Extract-Protocol>
Total RNA was extracted with TRIzolTM reagent (Gibco/BRL, Life Technologies Inc., Burlington, ON, Canada). RNA was extracted directly from homogenized cells grown to 80% confluence in 100-mm Petri dishes. RNA quality was monitored with a 2100 Bioanalyzer and RNA 6000 Nano LabChip kit (Agilent Technologies, Missisauga, Ontario, Canada) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
      </Extract-Protocol>
      <Label>Biotin</Label>
      <Label-Protocol>
Reverse Transcription was performed on 1 µg of total RNA with the SuperScriptTM First-Strand Synthesis System (Invitrogen Canada Inc., Burlington, Ontario, Canada) and random hexamers, according to the procedure recommended by the manufacturer. c-DNA samples were diluted at 1/3 or 1/6 in water prior to q-RT-PCR. Three µl of this dilution were used for each experiment. An in vitro transcription was performed on this cDNA and the resulting cRNA was biotinylated via incorporation of biotinylated dUTP and dCTP. DNA from samples was fragmented in 40mM Tris acetate, 100mM potassium acetate, and 30mM MgCl2 (pH 8.1) at 951C in order to reduce secondary structure.
      </Label-Protocol>
    </Channel>
    <Hybridization-Protocol>
A measure of 15 mg of cRNA was hybridized to an Affymetrix HuGeneFL microarray. Following hybridization, the arrays were washed and stained with streptavidin-phycoerythrin.
    </Hybridization-Protocol>
    <Scan-Protocol>
Microarrays were scanned with a Hewlett Packard Gene Array scanner.
    </Scan-Protocol>
    <Data-Processing>
Gene expression data were corrected for background using the Robust Multiarray Averaging (RMA) package, normalized using the Quantile method and summarized using the Median Polish method. Differentially-expressed probesets (DEPS) were identified on the basis of a moderated t-statistic computed with the Bioconductor Limma package for each contrast of two a priori classes of samples. The Benjamini and Hochberg (BH) correction method was applied to control the false discovery rate across all genes. DEPS retained as candidates correspond to probesets with q-value (adjusted BH p-values) ≤ 0.05 for most of the comparisons with the exception of the M1/2 vs. TM1/2 contrast where q-value was ≤ 0.2.

The Benjamini and Hochberg (BH) correction method was applied to control the false discovery rate across all genes. DEPS retained as candidates correspond to probesets with q-value (adjusted BH p-values) ≤ 0.05 for most of the comparisons with the exception of the M1/2 vs. TM1/2 contrast where q-value was ≤ 0.2.

      <Treatment-Protocol>
Morphologically normal surface epithelium cells were obtained by gently scraping, 2-3 times with a rubber scraper, the ovarian surface epithelium of the surgical specimen provided by the pathologist. The cells collected were then seeded in standard OSE medium consisting of 50:50 medium 199:105 (Sigma) supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 2.5 µg/mL amphotericin B and 50 µg/mL gentamicin.
      </Treatment-Protocol>
      <Growth-Protocol>
After rinsing, an explant of the surgical specimen was placed in 35-mm culture dishes, and held surface down so that the ovarian surface epithelium was maintained in a small amount of medium in contact with the bottom of the culture dishes, allowing the NOSEs to colonize the plastic. The cells were then passaged at 80% of confluence. A subgroup of NOSEs was cultivated in a modified medium (MM) i.e. the standard OSE medium supplemented with epidermal growth factor, hydrocortisone, insulin and bovine pituitary extract. Finally, tumors of ovaries (TOVs) were established in OSE medium supplemented with 10% FBS.

Total RNA was extracted with TRIzolTM reagent (Gibco/BRL, Life Technologies Inc., Burlington, ON, Canada). RNA was extracted directly from homogenized cells grown to 80% confluence in 100-mm Petri dishes. RNA quality was monitored with a 2100 Bioanalyzer and RNA 6000 Nano LabChip kit (Agilent Technologies, Missisauga, Ontario, Canada) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.

      <Label-Protocol>
Reverse Transcription was performed on 1 µg of total RNA with the SuperScriptTM First-Strand Synthesis System (Invitrogen Canada Inc., Burlington, Ontario, Canada) and random hexamers, according to the procedure recommended by the manufacturer. c-DNA samples were diluted at 1/3 or 1/6 in water prior to q-RT-PCR. Three µl of this dilution were used for each experiment. An in vitro transcription was performed on this cDNA and the resulting cRNA was biotinylated via incorporation of biotinylated dUTP and dCTP. DNA from samples was fragmented in 40mM Tris acetate, 100mM potassium acetate, and 30mM MgCl2 (pH 8.1) at 951C in order to reduce secondary structure.

      <Treatment-Protocol>
Morphologically normal surface epithelium cells were obtained by gently scraping, 2-3 times with a rubber scraper, the ovarian surface epithelium of the surgical specimen provided by the pathologist. The cells collected were then seeded in standard OSE medium consisting of 50:50 medium 199:105 (Sigma) supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 2.5 µg/mL amphotericin B and 50 µg/mL gentamicin.
      </Treatment-Protocol>
      <Growth-Protocol>
After rinsing, an explant of the surgical specimen was placed in 35-mm culture dishes, and held surface down so that the ovarian surface epithelium was maintained in a small amount of medium in contact with the bottom of the culture dishes, allowing the NOSEs to colonize the plastic. The cells were then passaged at 80% of confluence. A subgroup of NOSEs was cultivated in a modified medium (MM) i.e. the standard OSE medium supplemented with epidermal growth factor, hydrocortisone, insulin and bovine pituitary extract. Finally, tumors of ovaries (TOVs) were established in OSE medium supplemented with 10% FBS.

      <Extract-Protocol>
Total RNA was extracted with TRIzolTM reagent (Gibco/BRL, Life Technologies Inc., Burlington, ON, Canada). RNA was extracted directly from homogenized cells grown to 80% confluence in 100-mm Petri dishes. RNA quality was monitored with a 2100 Bioanalyzer and RNA 6000 Nano LabChip kit (Agilent Technologies, Missisauga, Ontario, Canada) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.

      <Label>Biotin</Label>
      <Label-Protocol>
Reverse Transcription was performed on 1 µg of total RNA with the SuperScriptTM First-Strand Synthesis System (Invitrogen Canada Inc., Burlington, Ontario, Canada) and random hexamers, according to the procedure recommended by the manufacturer. c-DNA samples were diluted at 1/3 or 1/6 in water prior to q-RT-PCR. Three µl of this dilution were used for each experiment. An in vitro transcription was performed on this cDNA and the resulting cRNA was biotinylated via incorporation of biotinylated dUTP and dCTP. DNA from samples was fragmented in 40mM Tris acetate, 100mM potassium acetate, and 30mM MgCl2 (pH 8.1) at 951C in order to reduce secondary structure.
      </Label-Protocol>
    </Channel>
    <Hybridization-Protocol>
A measure of 15 mg of cRNA was hybridized to an Affymetrix HuGeneFL microarray. Following hybridization, the arrays were washed and stained with streptavidin-phycoerythrin.
    </Hybridization-Protocol>
    <Scan-Protocol>
Microarrays were scanned with a Hewlett Packard Gene Array scanner.
    </Scan-Protocol>
    <Data-Processing>
Gene expression data were corrected for background using the Robust Multiarray Averaging (RMA) package, normalized using the Quantile method and summarized using the Median Polish method. Differentially-expressed probesets (DEPS) were identified on the basis of a moderated t-statistic computed with the Bioconductor Limma package for each contrast of two a priori classes of samples. The Benjamini and Hochberg (BH) correction method was applied to control the false discovery rate across all genes. DEPS retained as candidates correspond to probesets with q-value (adjusted BH p-values) ≤ 0.05 for most of the comparisons with the exception of the M1/2 vs. TM1/2 contrast where q-value was ≤ 0.2.

Differentially-expressed probesets (DEPS) were identified on the basis of a moderated t-statistic computed with the Bioconductor Limma package for each contrast of two a priori classes of samples. The Benjamini and Hochberg (BH) correction method was applied to control the false discovery rate across all genes. DEPS retained as candidates correspond to probesets with q-value (adjusted BH p-values) ≤ 0.05 for most of the comparisons with the exception of the M1/2 vs. TM1/2 contrast where q-value was ≤ 0.2.

      <Treatment-Protocol>
Morphologically normal surface epithelium cells were obtained by gently scraping, 2-3 times with a rubber scraper, the ovarian surface epithelium of the surgical specimen provided by the pathologist. The cells collected were then seeded in standard OSE medium consisting of 50:50 medium 199:105 (Sigma) supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 2.5 µg/mL amphotericin B and 50 µg/mL gentamicin.
      </Treatment-Protocol>
      <Growth-Protocol>
After rinsing, an explant of the surgical specimen was placed in 35-mm culture dishes, and held surface down so that the ovarian surface epithelium was maintained in a small amount of medium in contact with the bottom of the culture dishes, allowing the NOSEs to colonize the plastic. The cells were then passaged at 80% of confluence. A subgroup of NOSEs was cultivated in a modified medium (MM) i.e. the standard OSE medium supplemented with epidermal growth factor, hydrocortisone, insulin and bovine pituitary extract. Finally, tumors of ovaries (TOVs) were established in OSE medium supplemented with 10% FBS.

      <Extract-Protocol>
Total RNA was extracted with TRIzolTM reagent (Gibco/BRL, Life Technologies Inc., Burlington, ON, Canada). RNA was extracted directly from homogenized cells grown to 80% confluence in 100-mm Petri dishes. RNA quality was monitored with a 2100 Bioanalyzer and RNA 6000 Nano LabChip kit (Agilent Technologies, Missisauga, Ontario, Canada) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
      </Extract-Protocol>
      <Label>Biotin</Label>
      <Label-Protocol>
Reverse Transcription was performed on 1 µg of total RNA with the SuperScriptTM First-Strand Synthesis System (Invitrogen Canada Inc., Burlington, Ontario, Canada) and random hexamers, according to the procedure recommended by the manufacturer. c-DNA samples were diluted at 1/3 or 1/6 in water prior to q-RT-PCR. Three µl of this dilution were used for each experiment. An in vitro transcription was performed on this cDNA and the resulting cRNA was biotinylated via incorporation of biotinylated dUTP and dCTP. DNA from samples was fragmented in 40mM Tris acetate, 100mM potassium acetate, and 30mM MgCl2 (pH 8.1) at 951C in order to reduce secondary structure.
      </Label-Protocol>

    <Title>Gene Expression in Normal and Tumor Ovarian Epithelial Cells from Non-carriers and Heterozygous Carriers of a BRCA French Canadian Mutation.</Title>

    <Summary>
We hypothesized that the transcriptome of primary cultures of morphologically normal ovarian surface epithelial cells could be altered by the presence of a heterozygous BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation. We aimed to discover early events associated to ovarian carcinogenesis, which could represent putative targets for preventive strategies of this silent killer tumor. We identified the first molecular signature associated with French Canadian BRCA1 or BRCA2  founder mutations in morphologically normal ovarian epithelial cells. We discovered that wild-type and mutated BRCA2 allelic transcripts were expressed not only in morphologically normal but also in tumor cells from 8765delAG BRCA2 carriers.  Further analysis of morphologically normal ovarian and tumor cells from C4446T BRCA1 carriers lead to the same observation. Our data support the idea that one single hit in BRCA1 or BRCA2 is sufficient to alter the transcriptome of phenotypically normal ovarian epithelial cell. The highest level of BRCA2 mutated allele transcript expression was measured in cells originating from the most aggressive ovarian tumor. The penetrance of the mutation and the aggressiveness of the related tumor could depend on a dosage effect of the mutated allele transcript.
    </Summary>
    <Overall-Design>
We studied the molecular profiles associated with 5 a priori classes of samples : 4 non-familial morphologically normal ovarian surface epithelium (NOSEs) : NM class, 2 BRCA1-mutated NOSEs : M1 class, 3 BRCA2-mutated NOSEs : M2 class, 3 BRCA1-mutated ovarian tumor cells (TOVs) : TM1 class and one BRCA2-mutated TOV :TM2 class. No technical replicates were included in this study. The following contrasts were computed : NM vs. M1, NM vs. M2, M1 vs. M2, M1 vs. TM1 and M (M1 union M2) vs. TM (TM1 union TM2).
