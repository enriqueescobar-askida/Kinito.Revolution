This zip file has been downloaded from:
http://www.pep-net.org/programs/mpia/training-material/

It contains the GPCEMA general purpose cross-entropy matrix adjustment program 
GPCEMA.gms.

It also contains 4 unbalanced matrices as examples to illustrate the behavior 
of the adjustment procedure in different cases:

- Input.xls is the default example, a standard adjustment problem. 

- Zero_col_tot.xls is an example of a case 2 problem.

- Zero_line_tot.xls is an example of a case 3 problem.

- Zero_margins.xls is an example of a case 4 problem.

- Input.gms is a text file that may be used as an alternate method of reading 
  the problem data.

For further details, please refer to the comments in the GAMS program and to 
the included program documentation GPCEMA.pdf. Comments and inquiries may be 
sent to andre_lemelin@ucs.inrs.ca.
